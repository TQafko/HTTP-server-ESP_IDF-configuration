
### HTTP Server using SoftAP Mode in ESP32

The server allowes an ESP32 Module to be programmed via ESP-IDF application from here "https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf"

The current setup can be used as a template to jump start your projects.

It will set up a few templates for you to begin controlling some GPIO pins
with a few buttons in an html page.

CSS and Javascripts may also be added for further functionality.

### To Build

You must have followed introductions for how to instal esp-idf in your
device. If you have already done that you can copy the files in your reposetory and 
build the project and flash it to the board, then run the monitor tool to view the serial output:

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.
